---------------

To improve quality and usability any feedback is highly welcome! To maintain a
good transparency and professional work for my, please respect the following
recommendations how to feed back.

.. note:: Please report issues / bugs here:

In case of a bug report please have a good description (maybe a screenshot if it‘s
related to GUI) and add the log file(s). Normally you just could drop the log file
(or PNG in case of a screen shot) directly to the webpage issues on GitHub. In
some cases GitHub does not accept the file format (unfortunately for example FITs
files). I this case, please zip them and drop the zipped file. This will work. If
you have multiple files, please don‘t zip them to one file! I need them separated
and zipped causes more work.

If changes are made due to a feedback, new releases will have a link to the
closed issues on GitHub.
