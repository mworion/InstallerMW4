Welcome to MW4_Installer!
=========================
MW4 is a general utility for 10micron users for improving the workflow for astronomy
work. It runs on Windows11, Windows10 (Win7 should be fine, but it will be not
tested), Mac OSX (beginning from 10.12 to 14.x) including Mx variants if Rosetta is
used and Linux (Ubuntu from 16.04 to 22.04). If you have some knowledge around
Raspberry Pi's and other SOC, you might be able to install MW4 on a RPi3+, RPi4,
an RPi5.

---------------

In case of a bug report please have a good description (maybe a screenshot if it‘s
related to GUI) and add the log file(s). Normally you just could drop the log file
(or PNG in case of a screen shot) directly to the webpage issues on GitHub. In
some cases GitHub does not accept the file format (unfortunately for example FITs
files). I this case, please zip them and drop the zipped file. This will work. If
you have multiple files, please don‘t zip them to one file! I need them separated
and zipped causes more work.

If changes are made due to a feedback, new releases will have a link to the closed
issues on GitHub.
