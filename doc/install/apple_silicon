Installation on Apple Silicon
-----------------------------
For software that is not yet updated, Apple has built in translation software
called Rosetta 2. Rosetta 2 will interpret  traditional Intel-based code and
make it look like ARM-based code. And it does this pretty well. Generally
speaking as a user it is very difficult to distinguish between apps that have
‘native M1 support’ to traditional Intel-based apps.

But for any apps that are run from the command-line in Terminal, this standard
Rosetta 2 translation does not happen. Within Astrophotography it is not
uncommon to have apps that run from the command-line. Please hav a look to:
